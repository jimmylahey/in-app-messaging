## What is in-app messaging?

In-app messaging is used within mobile and desktop applications to engage with the user and/or otherwise provide information to enhance their experience in real-time.

In-app notifications are often used to offer support, reminders, marketing materials, and automated feedback to users while they are actively using your app.
